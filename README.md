## Frognar
Hello, my name is Sebastian. I embarked on my professional programming journey in 2021,
following six years of passionate involvement as a hobbyist.
My primary expertise lies in C#, although my programming foundation began with C++ and Java,
and I've also explored Python to broaden my skill set.
Presently, I'm delving into event sourcing to enhance my understanding of advanced system designs,
with aspirations to further expand my knowledge by studying F# in the near future.
